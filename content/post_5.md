title: Building Permit in Boston during COVID-19, and City's Development Trend
---


Research Question 1: How does COVID pandemic affect about Building permits, what is the trend for Building permit from 2006 to 2021?

I created a line graph for 2010-2020 see- ing the number of building permits per year peaking before the COVID-19 pan- demic in 2019. In 2010, I also saw the market and economy still suffering from the financial crisis in 2008-2009.
Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, annual permits appear to have peaked in 2019. As mentioned earlier, the decade 2010- 2020 was surrounded by a financial crisis and a global pandemic, so it should be expected that the urban cycle of redevel- opment experienced a natural increase in the years between these two events. It will be interesting to see if the sharp de- cline in building permits initiated in 2020 will rebound at the same level in 2021.

Research Question 2: How does the Building permit distribution in Boston area, which area has most Building permit and what is the building types of each permit, what is the Boston’s construction development plan?

Finally, the top10 neighborhoods isolated, the types of land use that comprises each area and how they are unique and similar. It can clearly see majority of development is occurring in Downtown. It also notice that most neighborhoods in this redevelopment cycle are dominated by com- mercial and multi family (7+) development. This could perhaps be a good indicator of neighborhood mainly focus redevelopment on those fields.


Research Question 3: What is the difference between construction’s added values and its existing values, which types of properties were seeing the most improvement in value in redevelopment? What is the future development plan for city of Boston?

Based on the maps, it can clearly see the building added values vs total values ratio the South Boston has higher ratio when it excluded Logan airport. It means South Boston having more investment compared to North Boston. By looking at the average age of building in each neighborhood, the Buildings located at the South Boston were older than North Boston. As I combined those map, the government sent more money on redeveloping the city. Like the plot from question 1, there is a rapidly growth in 2009 to 2010 which I assume that in 2022 there will be a rapid growth on Building permit, and especially concentrate on South Boston’s development, which can equalize the resource and economy among entire Boston city.
