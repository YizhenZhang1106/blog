title: The effect of COVID on NYC citizens by income in 2020
---

![NewYork](/blog/post_4_files/NYC1.png)

NYC has a vast income disparity by borough. The Bronx has one of the largest populations in NYC, second to Queens, but it contains the least amount of wealth (in comparison to population size). Brooklyn is composed of a population that has varied income, but most of the population makes less than $50,000 or are unemployed. Manhattan is the 3rd largest borough in terms of population, and the majority make over $50,000. Queens is the largest borough and has a mixed income population, with the majority making under $50,000 and a high unemployment rate.

COVID has very much effected NYC on an income level, impacting Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. The line graphs to the left depict the cases infection cases, hospitalizations, and deaths (A, B, and C) over time.

Peak COVID infection occurred in Aril, the min and max for this time period are labeled for graphs A, B, and C. Queens has the highest COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, while Staten Island had the lowest. This makes sense since Queens had the largest population and Staten Island the smallest. In terms of population size Manhattan is larger than Brooklyn; however, Brooklyn had the second highest COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, while Manhattan had the second lowest. The difference between Brooklyn and Manhattan COVID cases, hospitalizations, and deaths is vast.

Vaccinations seem to be evenly distributed between all the boroughs, where vaccinations are most dense in areas where there is public transportation and hospitals.
